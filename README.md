# issue as a service

[![issue as a Service](https://img.shields.io/badge/iaas-issue%20as%20a%20service-green)](https://github.com/maguowei/iaas)

## 思路

- [x] issue with a link -> github action -> download -> release asset
- [ ] append action link to issue
- [ ] 限制触发用户(安全) [github.actor](https://help.github.com/en/articles/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context)
- [ ] 支持指定运行环境 [Supported virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#supported-virtual-environments)
- [ ] result to slack
